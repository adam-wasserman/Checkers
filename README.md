USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Play the game like regular checkers. Player 1 is white, and they go first. To move, click on one of your pieces, and all the possible squares to which you can move will be highlighted in yellow. Click one of these squares to move. Click anywhere else to cancel. You can only move when it's your turn. If you make a jump, you may jump again (provided such a move is available). If you do not wish to jump again, pass the turn by clicking the piece that jumped
